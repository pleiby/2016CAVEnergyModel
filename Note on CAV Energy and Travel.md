Speed/MPG Relationship
====================

Estimates from FuelEconomy.gov
-------------------------
* See [Driving More Efficiently/Observe the Speed Limit](http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/driveHabits.jsp)
> Speed-mpg relationships are based on dynamometer tests of 74 light-duty vehicles representing a variety of manufacturers, nine vehicle classes, engine sizes 1.5 L to 6.2 L, and model years 2003 to 2012. Almost all are conventional gasoline-powered vehicles. Only one diesel and two hybrids are included; no plug-in hybrids or electric vehicles were tested.

>These estimates work best for well-maintained modern gasoline light-duty vehicles and will likely be less accurate for diesels, hybrids, and vehicles with cylinder deactivation. Their applicability to plug-in hybrids and electric vehicles is unknown.

>We estimate vehicle MPG at steady-state cruising speeds based on the vehicle's EPA "highway" fuel economy rating. These estimates are typically higher than both the EPA highway MPG ratings and the MPG consumers experience in on-road highway driving. Therefore, our cost and savings estimates should be conservative.
