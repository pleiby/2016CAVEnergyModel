CAVESIM Temp Notes for Development
==================================

Completed 20190922 CAVdecom version
-----------------------------------

- This version: reset to Reproduce base test calculations in prior spreadsheet
    - see logical switch variantTechScen4 <- F, resets results to match test spreadsheet. Value T halves energy intensity savings in TechScen 4 for section 8 exploration of Pooling impacts

- display Printed date automatically
- use logical flag variantTechScen4 to switch off variant
- standardize numerical check reporting as "Check:"
- try using fn `janitor::adorn_totals()` for sum over rows

- _omits_ Variant input set in Section 3.2: "LDV Energy Intensity Reduction is halved for TechScen 4""
- satisfies Benchmark 0 checks on paramters and results
    - 3.2 Energy Intensity by Vehicle Type and Technology Scenario, by Composing Mechanism Effects
        - Check: Calculated Net Energy Intensity Changes match old workbook test values to within 1.287431e-09 total absolute error.
    - 4.5 Fractional VMT Changes in CAV Demand Scenario (Single Tech Case)
        - Check: Calculated test output to Kaya (VMTIncrease table) matches examples for CombScen in CS1 CS2 CS3 CS4 CS5 CS6 CS7 to within 3.783225e-08
    - 5.1 Final Scenario Results Table for 2050
        - Check: Calculated values match Scenario Results test values (intensity, VMT, EUse) to within total absolute error  6.526996e-09.
    - 8.1 Consider alternative occupancy levels, and their effects on costs, PMT, and VMT
        - Not checked yet
        
20190924 Version CAVESIMver10
------------------------------

- Partial inclusion of SMART Workflow Scens B & C, low & high
    - add 4 scenarios to DemScen, CombScen (no changes to TechScen set)
    - Clarify that CombScen is a combination of DemScen and TechScen
        - CombScen not in DemScenAdjustments
    - A DemScen is a combination of (non-energy) cost shifts, demand response factors, and exog demand shifts.
    - Refine RidePoolAdj changes to VKT from hailing/pooling
        - case-dependent effect left_joined to VMTIncrease df
        - but need to subdivide travel categories by vehicle Automation and Use (Private v. Shared)
    - Still need to make finer distinctions re VoTT changes (by Veh type and Travel category type, e.g. Hwy vs. Arterial)
    - CaseEffectsEI more clearly named TechScenEffectsEI
    - Define CombScen in CombScen_Combinations table
    - Select Combined cases CombScen from full set generated by loop over GatherScenInputsForOneTechScen()
- Limitations
    - Too many place require manual (literal) listing of Cases, e.g. initialization of VTCShrAlt
    - Need to consider multiple levels of Sharing impact on VMT

ToDo Next 20190922
--------------------
1. Establish technology and demand scenario assump starting points in CAVdecom code
    - Eliminate refs to spreadsheet tests, reading and melding of spreadsheet params
2. Break out key parameter dataframes and save as CSVs
2. Save as CAVESIMver10.Rmd
3. Establish new set of scenarios: Base, B-Low, B-High, C-low, C-high
4. Include Accessory Load Energy use 
    - (convert kW to fraction of base vehicle average energy use (V [MPH] / E [MPG]) * kWh/Gal * EngineEffiency= kWh/h 
    - or get estimate of ave power use by vehicle
5. Update VoTT to conform to the scenarios
6. Update vehicle categories and stock-related data to conform to the analysis
    - K_CSDAO
        - C Class: LDV vs MDHDV
        - S Subclass: {Car vs LtTruck}, {Class8 vs Other}
            - Car {CAR_COMPACT, CAR_MID, CAR_FULL}
            - LtTruck {SUC_COMPACT ... SUV_FULL_SIZE, TRUCK_MID, TRUCK_FULL}
        - F Fuel/Drivetrain technology
            - Conventional (Conventional, Conv-48V)
            - HEV
            - PHEV
            - BEV
        - Automation
            - No (Manual)
            - Partial
            - Full
        - O Ownership/Operation
            - Private
            - Shared
    - AV vs MV shares
    - Partial vs. Full AV shares
    - shares/quantities of vehicls by class: 
        - LDV (Cars, LtTrucks) and HDV Stock
    - Electric vehicle vs "conventional" drivetrain
- Update reference ride sharing in each scenario
    - XXX
- Update Base impact of automation/sharing on VMT (repositioning empty ZOV miles)
    - see comparison with POLARIS
- Results
    - Produce Bar charts of AV cost components and shares
    - Produce Bar charts of energy intensity, VMT and energy
    - Produce Graphs of energy, VMT, PMT vs occupancy, for 
    - Produce Graphs of energy use vs cost (by mile and gallon)
        
Next Steps for Benchmarking and Refining
-----------------------------------------
- Include vehicle type shifts in TechScen
    - Automation fractions
    - Electrification fractions
- Include other factors in DemScen
    - Use/Ownership (shared vs. private) fractions
- Seek to benchmark average speed for local and intercity driving, for both LDVs and HDVs.
- Better-represent ways CAVs could alter average speed, and therefor travel time cost per mile.
- Add energy demand from automation load
    - can this fit in fractional change approach, given usually specified as fixed load?
    - see bounds report for reference
- Alter cost-elastic response to account for pooling. 
    Currently, the `VMTIncrease` table of `fracVMTincr` calculations applies the _VKT_ elasticity, estimated and appropriate for cost response at the reference level (near zero) pooling.

- Benchmark 
    - ReductCTAutomation    = 0.5   #   rho_A, reduction factor for the Cost of Travel Time (per hour) (now scenario dependent)
    - elas_VoTT_wrt_o <- 0.5 #    elas_{C_T,o}, elasticity of Cost of Travel time C_T = VoTT, w.r.t. occupancy,
        - an assumption regarding how higher occupancy (pooling) increases time cost VoTT
    - Elas_TourLength_wrt_Pooling <- 0.0 # elasticity of Vehicle tour length (for mult pooled trips) w.r.t. occupancy
    - Elas_RiderDetour_wrt_Pooling <- 0.0 # elasticity of Passenger trip length w.r.t. occupancy and pooling
    - PacePi <- 1 / 39.98 # base or default pace, hr/mi
    - ReductPaceAutomation <- 1 #     PaceReduct_A, reduction factor for the pace (hr/km) (or increase in average speed), i.e. the quantity of travel time per trip, from automation
- Review Data assumptions obtainble from Capstone report
- Review Data assumptions obtainable from Bounding Update drafts

ToDos for Refining
-------------------
- Next steps for functions CombScenResultsForOneTechScen() and GatherScenInputsForOneTechScen()
    - use _local_ vars to make iteratively make calculations of many dataframes
        - nie
        - DemRespParams (need DemRespParamsBase)
        - VTCShrAlt (needs VTCShrBase)
        - RelTotCost (needs VTCShrAlt)
        - VMTIncrease (needs) RelTotCost)
        - VMTIncrease
    - collapse the two long, largely duplicative, functions into 1, or have the second call the first

- Section 8: need to extract VTCostAlt from full set of CaseAssumptions, selecting out DemScen, TechScen, ElasCase of interest.
