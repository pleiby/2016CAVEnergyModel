CAVESIM overview presentation for E. Boyd DOE

## CAVESIM OVerview
- inputs, 
- outputs, results at National Level
- assumptions
- type of questions the model can answer and 
- how it answers them. 

## Incorporating outputs or numbers from other SMART projects[^1]

- "walk through an example"
- Auld/Polaris shared/autonomous vehicle analysis (FY19 task building on work at/with UT Austin
    - HH/Private AV sharing model
    - Quantify impacts of SAV fleet system optimization strategies
        - using ATIS, optimal routing, efficient fleet operations

## Scope; LD CAVs 
- Up until this point CAVESIM has been looking at the impact of LD CAVs
- Re freight:
  - Understood that across SMART, not possible to consider freight for all projects in FY19.]

## Alternative Funding

- Quad chart originally called for $200K - 220K
- Currently listed in combination with other ORNL task for $330k
  - 1/2 (split w/ MA3T task) is $165k for FY19
- what could be accomplished with a 
  - $200k funding level
  - $250k funding level
    - "If this funding level is restrictive, Iâ€™d rather a scenario where freight is put on hold and effort is focused on LD rather than doing a rough job on freight and LD."

## Current Plans for FY19
- See [FY2019 CAVs_2B QuadChart](FY2019_SMART_CAVs_2B QuadChart_draft_20180823_zl_CAVESIMhighlighted.pptx)
  - "Generate ... national Impacts and MEP"
      - LDV, shared mobility (ride hailing/sharing) _initial_ HD/freight components
  - Benchmark to results and scenarios performed by other SMART program projects/models, in keeping with overall SMART Workflow"
  - ...
  - [help] "Update Bounding study"
