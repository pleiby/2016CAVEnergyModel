CAVESIM overview presentation for E. Boyd DOE

## CAVESIM OVerview
- inputs, 
- outputs, results at National Level
- assumptions
- type of questions the model can answer and 
- how it answers them. 

## Incorporating outputs or numbers from other SMART projects

- "walk through an example"

## Scope; LD CAVs 
- Up until this point CAVESIM has been looking at the impact of LD CAVs
- Re freight:
  - Understood that across SMART, not possible to consider freight for all projects in FY19.]

## Alternative Funding

- Quad chart originally called for $200K
- Currently listed in combination with other ORNL task for $320k
  - 1/2 is $160k
- what could be accomplished with a 
  - $200k funding level
  - $250k funding level
    - "If this funding level is restrictive, Iâ€™d rather a scenario where freight is put on hold and effort is focused on LD rather than doing a rough job on freight and LD."
