1,2,Cautiously optimistic,"Mainly driver assist, with only slight reduction in costs of travel. Advanced driver assist features enabling platooning about half the time on the highway, and provide drivers with continual feedback to realize some modest eco-driving benefits. Partial congestion relief from fewer accidents, but not from operational improvements.Improved crash avoidance enables partial weight reduction, but drivers are still in the loop and demanding better acceleration.Increases in highway speed are modest.",Mid,Mid,Zero,Zero,Mid,Mid,Zero,Zero,Mid,Mid,Mid,Mid,Opt,Opt,Opt,Opt,Mid,Mid,Zero,Zero,Zero,Zero,Zero,Zero,Mid,Mid,Mid,Mid,Zero,Zero,Opt,Opt
2,3,Have our cake & eat it too,"All of the potential benefits are realized, with little of the downside. Automation enables much smoother traffic operations and vastly fewer accidents, all but eliminating congestion from our roads. Eco-driving is widely adopted, since it no longer relies on drivers modifying their behaviors. On the highways, speed limits continue to keep traffic to about 70 mph, but ubiquitous platooning greatly reduces aerodynamic losses and fuel consumption. With drivers out of the loop and acceleration no longer important, engine power is greatly dialed back. As accidents become a rarity, vehicles become smaller and shed safety equipment. Despite the greater comfort and productivity of drivers, people still prefer not to be in their cars, and the value of drivers' time declines only by about half.

3,5,Dystopian nightmare,"Automation totally redefines what it means to travel by car. Drivers become mere occupants, freed to undertake more productive tasks. The perceived cost of the drivers time plummets, and drivers are much more willing to undertake lengthy and frequent journeys. Automated eco-driving fails to catch on, as drivers place a greater premium on travel time than on minimizing energy consumption. Vehicles are also capable of safe travel at higher speeds, increasing highway energy use. Platooning fails to materialize due to a regulatory quagmire, a liability minefield, and policy inaction. Congestion relief from operational improvements is overwhelmed by the sheer increase in traffic volume. Despite all this, the basic structure of the vehicle does not change, and new vehicles continue to see improvements in performance capabilities and continued growth in weight due to new features & functionality.",Zero,Zero,Zero,Zero,Zero,Zero,Zero,Zero,Zero,Zero,Zero,Zero,Pess,Pess,Pess,Pess,Zero,Zero,Zero,Zero,Zero,Zero,Zero,Zero,Zero,Zero,Zero,Zero,Zero,Zero,Pess,Pess
4,6,Strong responses,"Automation shakes up car travel in a big way. Most of the envisioned responses are large in magnitude -- we see big operational improvements and many fewer accidents. Automated eco-driving and platooning take over, and safety equipment and power become much less important. But at the same time, highway speeds increase markedly and travel demand grows substantially due to lower perceived costs of travel. Widespread adoption of mobility-on-demand services means that vehicles are ""right-sized"" for each trip.",Opt,Opt,Opt,Opt,Pess,Pess,Opt,Opt,Opt,Opt,Opt,Opt,Opt,Opt,Pess,Pess,Opt,Opt,Zero,Zero,Zero,Zero,Zero,Zero,Opt,Opt,Opt,Opt,Zero,Zero,Pess,Pess
5,2,"Driver assist, limited other benefits","Driver assist technologies are the dominant form of automation, but many envisioned benefits are not realized. Platooning is available but not widely used, as some insurers deter its use, and in any case it ends up proving difficult to meet up with other platooners on the highway. Highway speeds increase moderately, however, due to vehicles augmenting their drivers' reactions. Accidents are reduced but not eliminated, so congestion persists and crashworthiness remains an important feature. Since drivers are still in the loop, acceleration continues to improve per historic trends. The mix of vehicle sizes turns out to be largely unaffected by automation, and personal ownership remains the dominant mobility model.Driver-assist eco-driving tools prove relatively ineffective.",Pess,Pess,Zero,Zero,Zero,Zero,Zero,Zero,Zero,Zero,Zero,Zero,Opt,Opt,Mid,Mid,Pess,Pess,Zero,Zero,Zero,Zero,Zero,Zero,Zero,Zero,Zero,Zero,Zero,Zero,Mid,Mid

7,2,Stuck in the middle at Level 2,"Automation advances to Level 2, but many states balk at permitting Level 3 and 4 vehicles onto their roads, effectively shutting these vehicles out of the market. Mid-range benefits are obtained from platooning (both LDVs and HDVs) and low-end benefits from eco-driving in LDVs, mainly through driver-coaching systems and ""auto-pilot"" features designed to operate the vehicle in specific conditions. Accident rates decline, lowering insurance costs, and more elderly people drive longer, but the cost of in-vehicle time changes only slightly for most drivers.",Mid,Mid,Zero,Zero,Zero,Zero,Zero,Zero,Pess,Pess,Zero,Zero,Opt,Opt,Zero,Zero,Mid,Mid,Zero,Zero,Zero,Zero,Zero,Zero,Mid,Mid,Zero,Zero,Zero,Zero,Opt,Opt
