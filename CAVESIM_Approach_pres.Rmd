## CAVESIM Top-Down Conceptual Approach Complements Bottom-up National Aggregation and  Detailed Regional Analyses

![CAVESIM Top Down Conceptual Approach Diagram](./data/CAVESIM_Top_Down_Conceptual_Approach_Diagram_V1.png)

## National-level impacts (Top-down), Formulation

- Use economic (producer/consumer behavior) modeling to estimate demand, efficiency, ride sharing, congestion, energy use [other outcomes?]
- Utility-maximizing agent
  - Utility, $U{ij}$, depends on costs (vehicle, fuel, time)
  - Social costs also considered (emissions, congestion, accidents)
  - Analytic form allows exploring ranges of imposed costs with constraints under different combinations of inputs to find combinations producing maximum benefit

$$U_{ij} ~=~ u(\psi(C_i, M_{ij}, T_{ij}, G), N) - \phi(P_{ij}(F,M)) - \delta(A_i)$$
for *i*: AV or MV; *j*: urban or non-urban

## Variable Definitions

- $C_i$,    quantity of goods consumed
- $M_{ij}$, vehicle-miles traveled
- $T_{ij}$, time spent driving
- $G$,      government spending
- $N$,      leisure
- $P_{ij}$, quantity of pollution
- $A_i$,    severity-adjusted traffic accidents
- $L$,      labor supply
- $I =  (1 - t_L)L$, after-tax income
- $F_i$,    fuel consumption
- $P_F$,    fuel price, including taxes
- $H_i$,    vehicle and other driving costs

## Conceptual Approach in Words: Main Potential Impacts of Connectivity & Automation Represented, Estimated, and Interacted
1. **Summarize Effects on Vehicle Energy Intensity**
  - ~8 Identified technological mechanisms
2. **Summarize/Estimate Effects on Costs, Travel “Costs”**
  - Vehicle capital and operating costs, (including energy)
  - Time costs: VoTT/hr and speed, congestion
3. **Estimate Effects on Road Travel Demand** (VKT, PKT)
  - Total Demand (PKT) response to $\Delta$ cost/convenience
  - Shifts in Demand (apart from cost response)
    - New/underserved rider groups
    - Ride-hailing/Ride-pooling
    - Mode shifts (from transit, rail/bus, air)
4. **Model interactive/equilibrating effects** among (some) energy intensity, costs, and demand impacts

## High-level inputs/assumptions and outputs

- Summarize technological and operational “mechanisms” by which CAVs alter energy use and demand
    - CACC/Platooning
    - Eco-driving
    - Congestion mitigation (incl. traffic-flow control)
    - Altered highway speeds*
    - De-emphasized performance
    - Improved crash avoidance (light-weighting)
    - Increased feature load (incl. sensors/controls)
  	- Vehicle size & “Right-sizing”
    - _Ride "hailing“ and “pooling”_*
    - _Electrification_
    - Demand from New user groups
    - Demand response (mode shifts/induced demand)

## Analysis Steps
- Establish est. base energy intensity & demand impacts for mechanisms
    - At different levels of CAV penetration
- Summarize known cost information
- Summarize Key Response relationships*
    - Rebound, VoTT, congestion effects, ride-pooling
- Account for equilibrium interactions (through costs/benefits):       - demand/congestion/speed/safety/energy-intensity & cost
- Define and Model alt scenarios: (defines exogenous assumptions and endogenous)
- **Explore implications of alt conditions/costs on outcomes**


# 2. Connections to Other SMART Project Assumptions & Results

## Base inputs from "Scenario Generation" - Technology Info

## Issues/Questions
- Q: does abstracting from regional/temporal detail make sense?
	- What questions are we trying to answer?
	- How accurate a representation is "good enough to be useful"?
	- What can be learned with such a compact/aggregate system that is hard to learn with the full representation?
		- What about the NREL "Scenario Generation" model (YASDM)
- Q: How do we best support/contribute to the MEP measure?

# 4. Example Data

## Static Estimates of Energy Intensity Effects Updated and Made Dynamic

```{r showMechanismMultiplers, echo = F}

load(file="CAVdecom.sav")
IM %>% filter(Year==2050 & VC=="LDV") %>%
  kable(caption= "Intensity Multipliers by Vehicle-type, Year, and Case")
```

# 5. Overview of Analytical Approach

## Vehicle Energy Intensity Results from a Combination of Technological and Operational Mechanisms

* Note: Time and regions subscripts *t* and *r* are implicit throughout.
* $\Delta \mu_{kvi}$ is the incremental effect on energy intensity of mechanism *k* in technology scenario *i*, for vehicle type *v*
* $\Delta \delta_{kvi}$ is the incremental effect on demand (VKT) for effect *m* in demand scenario *j*, for vehicle type *v*

Each of these incremental energy intensity and travel demand effects may depend on costs *c*.

Energy use is the product of energy intensity *I* (Mj/veh-km) and travel VKT *M* (veh-km/yr):
$$E_{vij} ~=~ \prod_k \left ( 1 + \Delta \mu_{kvi}(c) \right ) \cdot I_{Ev0} \cdot \prod_m \left ( 1 + \Delta \delta_{mvj}(c) \right ) \cdot M_{Ev0}$$

## Unifying Demand Framework

Travel demand is based on utility maximization, with time and budget constraints.

$$
\begin {aligned}
max ~U ~&= ~u(M, T, C, G, X) - D_F(P(\bar F)) - D_M(A(\bar M))\\
s.t. ~& L + T + X \le \underline L \\
& (\tau_f+P_f) F + \tau_M M + H + C ~\le~ I \\
& I = (1-\tau_L) L \\
& M = m(F, H)
\end {aligned}
$$
Note we also include some consideration (tracking) of societal (non-market) costs associated with fuel use *F* and VKT *M*. These include, e.g. air emissions, accidents, and congestion.

## Aside

Technically, the separability of *u* in leisure *X* has useful implications.
$$u(M, T, C, G, X) = u(\phi(M, T, C, G), X)$$
It may be useful to separate out travel miles production by vehicle type, where vehicle have different energy and non-energy (capital) cost requirements.
$$M_v ~=~ f_v(F_v, H_v)$$

## Consider and Account How Automation Technologies Change Travel Costs, For a Range of Cost Components (incl. Energy)

(Important point is that fuel/energy is generally only a limited share of total travel costs.)

## Results: Explore how Economic Costs and Technology Changes Can Influence Behavior & Outcomes re Energy and VKT
