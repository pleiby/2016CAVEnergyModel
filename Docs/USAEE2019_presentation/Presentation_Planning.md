## Notes from Bounds work (Gohlke summary 10/31/2019)
- Simulated VMT and energy account for range of outcomes within impact bounds
  - Initial results ~90% of cases are between -25% and +160% VMT
  - Energy efficiency improvements mean +30% for energy consumption
    - 90% of cases between -35% and +120% vs non-automated
- Multiple possible assumptions are explored for vehicle efficiency.
  - Combining modest improvements in vehicle-level fuel economy with system-level improvements for fuel economy can change the 30% increase in national-scale fuel consumption to a 15% reduction, relative to todayâ€™s vehicles.
  - Using high-efficiency ICE vehicles can yield a -30% reduction
  - BEV CAVs (CAEVs) can reduce total energy consumption by 75%
