## Outline: Opportunities for Road Transport Carbon Reduction through Automation and Shared Mobility

1. Estimated Effects of Automation on travel demand, energy efficiency
2. Effect of Shared mobility on travel (PMT) while mitigating VMT
3. Suitability of electrification for Shared/Automated road travel
4. Net implications for VMT, energy use

## Multiple Factors Drive Energy/Oil Demand Outcomes: Helpful to Organize/Decompose with “ASIF” Framework

knitr::include_graphics(here(figureLocPath, "ASIF_Block_Diagram.png"))
```

## 1. Effects of Automation on road travel, energy use, emissions

### Travel Costs Per Mile:  Value of driver’s time is single largest cost of operating a vehicle. Fuel is <15% for cars, 35% for heavy trucks.

```{r, echo=F, out.width='65%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='Base Vehicle Cost Components'}
knitr::include_graphics(here(figureLocPath, "baseCostComponStackedBarGraph-1.png"))
```

## Cost Driven - Alt Costs (Automated Vehicle)

```

## 1.2 CAV Mechanisms and Effects – Estimated Changes to LDV Energy Intensity and Travel Demand

```{r, echo=F, out.width='75%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='Multiple mechanisms can alter vehicle energy intensity and travel'}
knitr::include_graphics(here(figureLocPath, "CAV_multiple_mechanisms_can_alter_intensity_and_activity_barV20191106final.png"))
# knitr::include_graphics(here(figureLocPath, "CAV_multiple_mechanisms_can_alter_intensity_and_activity_barV20191106.png"))
```
Multiple mechanisms can alter vehicle energy intensity and travel.
Impacts vary with connectivity, powertrain, and operating conditions.


## 1.3 Value (Cost) of Travel Time
- importance and heterogeneity
  - Fraction of wage rate (non-work) ~ 35% - 60% (DOT)
  - VOTT depends strongly on the purpose and quality of time
  - Trip purpose (work, leisure)
  - Demographics (sex, income, age, education)
- Value of Time Reliability
- Evidence to date and on-going research
  - chauffer experiment
  - empirical work: 
    - Stated preference
    - RP using proxies for CAV (transit, train, ride share)
- Some evidence for 20% - 75% Time Cost reduction, for personal CAV trips

## Studies: Relative Value of Time by Trip Purpose
- Work Purpose (relative to personal time)
  - A&W: 	2+
  - DOT: 	2 
  - Small: 	2 
- Personal Purposes: A&W
  - Commute v Leisure 	1.15
  - Peak v Off-Peak 	1.40
  - Commute v Shopping 	1.16
  - Shopping v Leisure 	0.84

## 2. Effect of Shared mobility on Travel (PMT) while mitigating Traffic (VMT)

#### Empirical data so far show large increase in VMT from TNCs. Empty miles from optimized (single) automated TNC could be lower.

Empty Fraction of TNC Miles	|	Study	|	Comments
--------------------|--------------------|------------------------------
41%	|Henao & Marshall 2018	|		Uber/Lyft Denver
37%	|Komanduri et al 2018	|		RideAustin Dataset (incl. assumed 2 mile commute)
36%-45%	|	Cramer & Kreuger 2016	|	From Uber data in 5 cities
40%	|	Schaller 2017	        |	NYC Ridesourcing, NYC Taxi Commission data
20%	|SF County Transp. Authority 2017	|		San Francisco city core, excl commuting, omits distance from request to pickup.
45%	| Wenzel et al. 2019	  |		RideAustin data, 26% for between-ride, 19% commuting.
20%	|Loeb et al 2018	      |		**Simulation** satisfying 40% of all trips under  50 miles in Austin


## Shared Mobility Could Sharply Reduce Number of Vehicles Needed to Meet Demand

- Some simulation studies show optimized ride services meet 90%+ trip demand with "acceptable" delay and 4-12X reduction in vehicles

- Not necess fewer vehicles on the road or less VMT.
- Much more intensively used, higher-turnover, vehicles.

## 3. Suitability/cost-effectiveness of electrification for Shared/Automated road travel
- Classic reasoning:
  - EVs, with high capital cost, low operating costs, and long service-life are better/well-suited to high-utilization (high VMT) applications
  - AVs make time/inconvenience of recharging less salient
- However
  - SAVs are profit oriented, and can ill-afford to be taken out of service long for recharging
  - AVs have high "auxilliary feature" loads, amplifying the problem of EV energy management, exacerbating range problem under low-speed operation
- Simple Calculations:
- Research:
  - 30% of Public DC Fast-charging in SF is TNC vehicles (Jenn 2019)

## Incentives Can Promote Higher Mobility Energy Productivity. Cost Signals Can Influence Energy & VMT Outcomes.

## Summary
1. Automation is highly valuable and *market-driven*, hence likely in some form(s)
    - time, safety, convenience, cost advantages
2. Automation can have significant VMT and energy use effects
   - from Induced Demand and Unoccupied Travel
3. For "Shared mobility" to help, need pooling (higher occupancy)
4. Widespread electrification can make a big difference.
    - Has some advantages, but not assured.
5. Refining understanding, but still a *wide range of potential outcomes* 
    - tech, behavioral, and policy uncertainty
6. Costs, incentives and policy matter
    - roadway/curb access priorities (e.g. CACC lanes)
    - road use charges
    - occupancy incentives, ZOV pricing strategies

* NLP or MCP optimization problem

## Study of Potential Ride-Pooling Potential on VKT, PKT

* Several studies have shown *ride‐hailing* may significantly increase VKT
  * added VKT from deadheading/repositioning/cruising between rides
  * Deadhead rates 25% – 60% (4 studies based on data)
  * Autonomous vehicles also have this concern
* But, **Ride‐pooling** (shared rides) can increase average vehicle occupancy and potentially reduce VKT
* **MOST** (Minimum Occupancy STandards) for TNCs: New policy tool to encourage ride‐pooling
  * Related _draft_ regulations: California Clean Miles Standard
* **Case study** of the MOST concept: use
publicly available data from RideAustin TNC [in progress]

## Ride Pooling Algorithm

- Sun & Zhang 2018, Alonso-Mora et al. 2017
- Establish ride sample time period, *n* rides
- **Initialize**
  - Generate compact abstract graph from street map for all Os and Ds
  - Determine route distances, times among *all* nodes $\{O_1 ... O_n, D_1, ... D_n\}$
    - i.e. $(2n)^2$ arcs
  - Base Assignment: single car to single ride
- **Iterate** (until no more ride insertions feasible)
  - *Insertions* 
    - Test inserting each unpooled ride *r* individually in all cars *k* w/ capacity
    - Construct graph of time-feasible routes w/ insertions, distances
  - *Assignment* ILP over $V_{kr} \in \{0,1\}$
    - select insertions to max VKT reduction
    - track APKT: passenger detours/delays

## Market Outcome: Occupancy Standard as an Optimization Problem

- Optimization problem maximizes economic net benefit, *subject to an Occupancy Standard* and feasibility constraints. 

- Benefits derive from the marginal benefit of travel *D* 

- Costs derive from passenger waiting time, passenger incremental travel time from detours in pooled rides, and TNC operating costs
<!--  - based on travel time and pickup/drop-off transaction time costs. -->

```

## Discussion: TNC Policy Planning/Data Challenges

* Observability & Attribution
  * Real deadhead miles v. deadhead miles registered for tax purposes
  * Most TNC drivers use more than one service which complicates firm-level analysis of VMT/deadheading
* Spatial accuracy
  * GPS coordinates, times, when provided, are not always accurate 
  * Other datasets round/blur location and time
    * Taxi trip data
* Ideally, need *demographics* and *trip purpose* for willingness to ride‐pool

## Ideal Pooled-Routing (~no detours/delays) Allows VKT (Energy) Reduction, Increased Mobility (PKT)

```{r, echo=F, out.width='65%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='Occupancy Effects With Ideal Routing (no detours)'}
knitr::include_graphics(here(figureLocPath, "plotOccupancyEffects-1.png"))
```

## Occupancy Effects with Less Direct Pooled-Routing (more detours)

```{r, echo=F, out.width='65%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='Occupancy Effects with Less Ideal Pooled-Routing (more detours)'}
knitr::include_graphics(here(figureLocPath, "plotOccupancyEffects1-1.png"))
```

## MOST Allows Increased PKT with Same/Lower VKT
* Increased vehicle occupancy can *decouple* passenger kilometers traveled (PKT) from vehicle kilometers traveled (VKT)
* A flexible occupancy standard $\bar O$ that focuses on the average ratio of passenger travel to vehicle travel

$$O = \left ( \frac {PKT}{VKT} \right ) \equiv \frac {(passenger-km/yr)}{(vehicle-km/yr)} \sim \left [ \frac {pass}{veh} \right ] \le \bar O$$

* Inspired by our prior work on tradable CAFE and low
carbon fuel standards.
* *In the process of implementing* the model using the **Ride Austin** data to synthesized pooled trips
  * Using a heuristic algorithm based on Sun and Zhang (2018).


## Obtain Functional Relationships From Vehicle Routing and Trip Chaining[^1]

1. $k_v(r)$ **Changes in vehicle travel with pooling *r* **: 
    * fractional increase in vehicle km needed to complete a typical set of chained or combined trips, as a function of pooling size *r*
    * compared to sum of direct rider O-D trip distances.
2. $k_p(r)$ **Changes in passenger route distance (time) with pool size *r* **: 
    * the fractional increase in passenger route distance km (due to detours), for a typical ride. 
  3. **Changes in waiting time** $T_{pw}(r)$: the incremental time per trip that the passenger must wait as a function of shared ridership r. 
      * Waiting time is expected to decline with measures of system scale (size of the TNC fleet and density $\delta$ of TNC travelers in service area)

[^1]: These functional relations may be derived from simulations of shared vehicles or actual travel data.


## RideAustin Data for Initial Test

* One year of data publicly available June 2016 - April 2017[^2]
* This is a unique dataset of TNC trips
  * 1.4 millions trips recorded
* For each trip:
  - Time and location of trip origin and destination
  - Fare and tip
  - Rider and driver ratings
  - Type of car requested
  - Weather
  - Dispatch time and location
  – Do not know number of passengers per ride
  – Do not know demographics of passengers
