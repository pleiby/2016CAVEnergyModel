## Exploring CAVs and Shared Mobility at Aggregate Level with CAVESIM

* Top-Down Methodology for modeling CAV Energy/Travel Demand
  * VKT, energy as function of cost/time-value/income/budget
  * Model estimates national (or regional) changes in VKT, fuel use
  * Founded in economic theory
    * emphasizes importance of cost economics for outcomes
  * Representative travelers behave according to constrained utility (preference) max
* (Computational) Side study: Benchmarking VKT, PKT and cost impacts of Ride *Pooling* from real ride-service trip data

## Study of Potential Ride-Pooling Potential on VKT, PKT

* Several studies have shown *ride‐hailing* may significantly increase VKT
  * added VKT from deadheading/repositioning/cruising between rides
  * Deadhead rates 25% – 60% (4 studies based on data)
  * Autonomous vehicles also have this concern
* But, **Ride‐pooling** (shared rides) can increase average vehicle occupancy and potentially reduce VKT
* **MOST** (Minimum Occupancy STandards) for TNCs: New policy tool to encourage ride‐pooling
  * Related _draft_ regulations: California Clean Miles Standard
* **Case study** of the MOST concept: use
publicly available data from RideAustin TNC [in progress]

## MOST Allows Increased PKT with Same/Lower VKT
* Increased vehicle occupancy can *decouple* passenger kilometers traveled (PKT) from vehicle kilometers traveled (VKT)
* A flexible occupancy standard $\bar O$ that focuses on the average ratio of passenger travel to vehicle travel

$$O = \left ( \frac {PKT}{VKT} \right ) \equiv \frac {(passenger-km/yr)}{(vehicle-km/yr)} \sim \left [ \frac {pass}{veh} \right ] \le \bar O$$
* Inspired by our prior work on tradable CAFE and low
carbon fuel standards.
* *In the process of implementing* the model using the **Ride Austin** data to synthesized pooled trips
  * Using a heuristic algorithm based on Sun and Zhang (2018).


## Obtain Functional Relationships From Vehicle Routing and Trip Chaining[^1]

1. $k_v(r)$ **Changes in vehicle travel with pooling *r* **: 
    * fractional increase in vehicle km needed to complete a typical set of chained or combined trips, as a function of pooling size *r*
    * compared to sum of direct rider O-D trip distances.
2. $k_p(r)$ **Changes in passenger route distance (time) with pool size *r* **: 
    * the fractional increase in passenger route distance km (due to detours), for a typical ride. 
  3. **Changes in waiting time** $T_{pw}(r)$: the incremental time per trip that the passenger must wait as a function of shared ridership r. 
      * Waiting time is expected to decline with measures of system scale (size of the TNC fleet and density $\delta$ of TNC travelers in service area)

[^1]: These functional relations may be derived from simulations of shared vehicles or actual travel data.

## Market Outcome: as an Optimization Problem

- Optimization problem maximizes economic net benefit, *subject to an Occupancy Standard* and feasibility constraints. 

- Benefits derive from the marginal benefit of travel *D* 

- Costs derive from passenger waiting time, passenger incremental travel time from detours in pooled rides, and TNC operating costs
<!--  - based on travel time and pickup/drop-off transaction time costs. -->

## RideAustin Data for Initial Test

* One year of data publicly available June 2016 - April 2017[^2]
* This is a unique dataset of TNC trips
  * 1.4 millions trips recorded
* For each trip:
  - Time and location of trip origin and destination
  - Fare and tip
  - Rider and driver ratings
  - Type of car requested
  - Weather
  - Dispatch time and location
  – Do not know number of passengers per ride
  – Do not know demographics of passengers

```

## Ride Pooling Algorithm

- Sun & Zhang 2018, Alonso-Mora et al. 2017
- Establish ride sample time period, *n* rides
- **Initialize**
  - Generate compact abstract graph from street map for all Os and Ds
  - Determine route distances, times among *all* nodes $\{O_1 ... O_n, D_1, ... D_n\}$
    - i.e. $(2n)^2$ arcs
  - Base Assignment: single car to single ride
- **Iterate** (until no more ride insertions feasible)
  - *Insertions* 
    - Test inserting each unpooled ride *r* individually in all cars *k* w/ capacity
    - Construct graph of time-feasible routes w/ insertions, distances
  - *Assignment* ILP over $V_{kr} \in \{0,1\}$
    - select insertions to max VKT reduction
    - track APKT: passenger detours/delays

## End Goal is Compilation of Costs Changes With Pooling, and Marginal Cost Analysis

## Discussion: Data Challenges

* Observability & Attribution
  * Real deadhead miles v. deadhead miles registered for tax purposed
  * Most TNC drivers use more than one service which complicates firm-level analysis 
* Spatial accuracy
  * GPS coordinates, times, when provided, are not always accurate 
  * Other datasets round/blur location and time
    * Taxi trip data
* Ideally, need *demographics* and *trip purpose* for willingness to ride‐pool

## Discussion: Tools and Methods
  * Routing algorithms, network modeling software
    * currently only some steps/functions parallelized
    * seeking greater scalability
  * HPC ILP and NLP approaches
    * Gurobi = \$ (no NLP)
    * Julia JuMP for HPC math programmming, anyone?
* Collaborations welcome
  * Feedback
