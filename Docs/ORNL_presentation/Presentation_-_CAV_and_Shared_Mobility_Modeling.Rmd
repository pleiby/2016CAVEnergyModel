## Exploring CAVs and Shared Mobility at Aggregate Level with CAVESIM

* Top-Down Methodology
  * VKT, energy as function of cost/time-value/income/budget
  * Model estimates national (or regional) changes in VKT, fuel use
  * Founded in economic theory
    * emphasizes importance of cost economics for outcomes
  * Representative travelers behave according to constrained utility (preference) max
* Side study: Benchmarking VKT, PKT and cost impacts of Ride *Pooling* from real ride-service trip data

## Study of Potential Ride-Pooling Potential on VKT, PKT

* Several studies have shown *ride‐hailing* may significantly increase VKT
  * added VKT from deadheading/repositioning/cruising between rides
  * Deadhead rates 25% – 60% (4 studies based on data)
  * Autonomous vehicles also have this concern
* But, **Ride‐pooling** (shared rides) can increase average vehicle occupancy and potentially reduce VKT
* **MOST** (Minimum Occupancy STandards) for TNCs: New policy tool to encourage ride‐pooling
  * Related _draft_ regulations: California Clean Miles Standard
* **Case study** of the MOST concept: use
publicly available data from RideAustin TNC [in progress]

## MOST Allows Increased PKT with Same/Lower VKT
* Increased vehicle occupancy can *decouple* passenger kilometers traveled (PKT) from vehicle kilometers traveled (VKT)
* A flexible occupancy standard $\bar O$ that focuses on the average ratio of passenger travel to vehicle travel

$$O = \left ( \frac {PKT}{VKT} \right ) \equiv \frac {(passenger-km/yr)}{(vehicle-km/yr)} \sim \left [ \frac {pass}{veh} \right ] \le \bar O$$
* Inspired by our prior work on tradable CAFE and low
carbon fuel standards.
* Are *in the process of implementing* the model using the **Ride Austin** data to synthesized pooled trips
  * Using a heuristic algorithm based on Sun and Zhang (2018).


## Obtain Functional Relationships From Vehicle Routing and Trip Chaining[^1]

1. $k_v(r)$ Changes in vehicle travel with pooling *r*: 
    * fractional increase in vehicle km needed to complete a typical set of chained or combined trips, as a function of pooling size *r*
    * compared to sum of direct rider O-D trip distances.
2. $k_p(r)$ Changes in passenger route distance with pool size *r*: 
    * the fractional increase in passenger route distance km (due to detours), for a typical ride. 
  3. Changes in waiting time $T_{pw}(r)$: the incremental time per trip that the passenger must wait as a function of shared ridership r. 
      * Waiting time is expected to decline with measures of system scale (size of the TNC fleet and density $\delta$ of TNC travelers in service area)

[^1]: These functional relations may be derived from simulations of shared vehicles or actual travel data.

## Market Outcome: as an Optimization Problem

- Optimization problem maximizes economic net benefit, *subject to an Occupancy Standard* and feasibility constraints. 

- Benefits derive from the marginal benefit of travel *D* 

- Costs derive from passenger waiting time, passenger incremental travel time from detours in pooled rides, and TNC operating costs
<!--  - based on travel time and pickup/drop-off transaction time costs. -->

## RideAustin Data for Initial Test

* One year of data publicly available June 2016 - April 2017[^2]
* This is a unique dataset of TNC trips
  * 1.4 millions trips recorded
* For each trip:
  - Time and location of trip origin and destination
  - Fare and tip
  - Rider and driver ratings
  - Type of car requested
  - Weather
  - Dispatch time and location
  – Do not know number of passengers per ride
  – Do not know demographics of passengers

## Ride Pooling Algorithm

- Sun & Zhang 2018, Alonso-Mora et al. 2017
- Establish ride sample time period, *n* rides
- Generate compact abstract graph from street map for all Os and Ds
- Determine route distances among *all* nodes $\{O_1, ... O_n, D_1, ..., D_n\}$
- Base Assignment of single car to single ride
- Iterate (until no more ride insertions feasible)
  - *Insertions* 
    - Test inserting each unpooled ride individually in all cars w/ capacity
    - Construct graph of feasible routes w/ insertions
  - *Assignment* ILP over $V_{ki}$ to select insertions to max VKT reduction

## End Goal is Compilation of Costs Changes With Pooling, and Marginal Cost Analysis

```

## Data Challenges
* Real deadhead miles v. deadhead miles registered to increase expenses to reduce taxable income
* Many/most TNC drivers use more than one service which complicates firm-level analysis 
* GPS coordinates, when provided, are not always accurate 
* Other datasets round/blur location and time

## Discussion

* Available data sets
  * Taxi trip data
  * Ideally, need *demographics* of riders and *trip purpose* to better infer willingness to ride‐pool
  * Low density routes/areas/time-of-day make pooling difficult
  * Ideally need to know alternative choice of travel if not ride‐hailing (transit, walk, personal vehicle)
* Tools and methods
  * routing algorithms, network modeling software
  * HPC ILP and NLP approaches
* Collaboration
  * Feedback
