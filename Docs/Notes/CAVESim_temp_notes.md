CAVESIM Temp Notes for Development
==================================

Completed 20190922 CAVdecom version
-----------------------------------

- This version: reset to Reproduce base test calculations in prior spreadsheet
    - see logical switch variantTechScen4 <- F, resets results to match test spreadsheet. Value T halves energy intensity savings in TechScen 4 for section 8 exploration of Pooling impacts

- display Printed date automatically
- use logical flag variantTechScen4 to switch off variant
- standardize numerical check reporting as "Check:"
- try using fn `janitor::adorn_totals()` for sum over rows

- _omits_ Variant input set in Section 3.2: "LDV Energy Intensity Reduction is halved for TechScen 4""
- satisfies Benchmark 0 checks on paramters and results
    - 3.2 Energy Intensity by Vehicle Type and Technology Scenario, by Composing Mechanism Effects
        - Check: Calculated Net Energy Intensity Changes match old workbook test values to within 1.287431e-09 total absolute error.
    - 4.5 Fractional VMT Changes in CAV Demand Scenario (Single Tech Case)
        - Check: Calculated test output to Kaya (VMTIncrease table) matches examples for CombScen in CS1 CS2 CS3 CS4 CS5 CS6 CS7 to within 3.783225e-08
    - 5.1 Final Scenario Results Table for 2050
        - Check: Calculated values match Scenario Results test values (intensity, VMT, EUse) to within total absolute error  6.526996e-09.
    - 8.1 Consider alternative occupancy levels, and their effects on costs, PMT, and VMT
        - Not checked yet
        
20190924 Version CAVESIMver10
------------------------------

- Partial inclusion of SMART Workflow Scens B & C, low & high
    - add 4 scenarios to DemScen, CombScen (no changes to TechScen set)
    - Clarify that CombScen is a combination of DemScen and TechScen
        - CombScen not in DemScenAdjustments
    - A DemScen is a combination of (non-energy) cost shifts, demand response factors, and exog demand shifts.
    - Refine RidePoolAdj changes to VKT from hailing/pooling
        - case-dependent effect left_joined to VMTIncrease df
        - but need to subdivide travel categories by vehicle Automation and Use (Private v. Shared)
    - Still need to make finer distinctions re VoTT changes (by Veh type and Travel category type, e.g. Hwy vs. Arterial)
    - CaseEffectsEI more clearly named TechScenEffectsEI
    - Define CombScen in CombScen_Combinations table
    - Select Combined cases CombScen from full set generated by loop over GatherScenInputsForOneTechScen()
- Limitations
    - Too many place require manual (literal) listing of Cases, e.g. initialization of VTCShrAlt
    - Need to consider multiple levels of Sharing impact on VMT

20190926 Version CAVESIMver10
------------------------------- 
- Include mix of vehicle types by Automation, Fuel, Use tpe.
    - Develop share-weighted results given F_A_Shares (for Fuel and Automation) and U_Share (for Use, i.e. Private/Shared)
    - Shares are developed from SMART FY19 Scenario COmmon Assumptions, processed by source()ing the "...DataPrep.R" script.
    - Add Test, Zero, and Base DemScens for comparison (Test should be close to old CombScen4) 
    - develop shifts (multipliers) for Automation effect onIntensity and VMT, based on Vehicle tech type: mI_A mI_C, mI_FA.
    - Also multiplier for overall efficiency (not Automation efficiency impact) mI_F
    - Delay application of VMT demand shift from Shared vehicle reposition to disaggregate impact phase.
    - New postProcessComScenarioResults chunk applies adjustments to I and VMT changes based on vehicle type
    - Share-weighted aggregation of fractional changes is tricky, see notes. 
       - Still testing
    - modified keepCaseWantedEffectsaAndAssumps chunk to aggregate back up to vehicle class VC level, to reproduce old bar charts.

        - exclude shift away from pooled with shared veh-only VMT charge
Next Steps for Benchmarking and Refining
-----------------------------------------
- Include vehicle type shifts in TechScen
    - Automation fractions
    - Electrification fractions
- Include other factors in DemScen
    - Use/Ownership (shared vs. private) fractions
- Seek to benchmark average speed for local and intercity driving, for both LDVs and HDVs.
- Better-represent ways CAVs could alter average speed, and therefor travel time cost per mile.
- Add energy demand from automation load
    - can this fit in fractional change approach, given usually specified as fixed load?
    - see bounds report for reference
- Alter cost-elastic response to account for pooling. 
    Currently, the `VMTIncrease` table of `fracVMTincr` calculations applies the _VKT_ elasticity, estimated and appropriate for cost response at the reference level (near zero) pooling.

- Benchmark 
    - ReductCTAutomation    = 0.5   #   rho_A, reduction factor for the Cost of Travel Time (per hour) (now scenario dependent)
    - elas_VoTT_wrt_o <- 0.5 #    elas_{C_T,o}, elasticity of Cost of Travel time C_T = VoTT, w.r.t. occupancy,
        - an assumption regarding how higher occupancy (pooling) increases time cost VoTT
    - Elas_TourLength_wrt_Pooling <- 0.0 # elasticity of Vehicle tour length (for mult pooled trips) w.r.t. occupancy
    - Elas_RiderDetour_wrt_Pooling <- 0.0 # elasticity of Passenger trip length w.r.t. occupancy and pooling
    - PacePi <- 1 / 39.98 # base or default pace, hr/mi
    - ReductPaceAutomation <- 1 #     PaceReduct_A, reduction factor for the pace (hr/km) (or increase in average speed), i.e. the quantity of travel time per trip, from automation
- Review Data assumptions obtainble from Capstone report
- Review Data assumptions obtainable from Bounding Update drafts

ToDos for Refining
-------------------
- Next steps for functions CombScenResultsForOneTechScen() and GatherScenInputsForOneTechScen()
    - use _local_ vars to make iteratively make calculations of many dataframes
        - nie
        - DemRespParams (need DemRespParamsBase)
        - VTCShrAlt (needs VTCShrBase)
        - RelTotCost (needs VTCShrAlt)
        - VMTIncrease (needs) RelTotCost)
        - VMTIncrease
    - collapse the two long, largely duplicative, functions into 1, or have the second call the first

- Section 8: need to extract VTCostAlt from full set of CaseAssumptions, selecting out DemScen, TechScen, ElasCase of interest.
