> Autonomous vehicles use sensing and communication technologies to navigate safely and
efficiently with little or no input from the driver. These driverless technologies will create
an unprecedented revolution in how people move, and policymakers will need appropriate
tools to plan for and analyze the large impacts of novel navigation systems. In this paper
we derive semiparametric estimates of the willingness to pay for automation. We use data
from a nationwide online panel of 1260 individuals who answered a vehicle-purchase discrete choice experiment focused on energy efficiency and autonomous features. Several
models were estimated with the choice microdata, including a conditional logit with deterministic consumer heterogeneity, a parametric random parameter logit, and a semiparametric random parameter logit. We draw three key results from our analysis. First, we
find that the **average household is willing to pay a significant amount for automation:
about $3500 for partial automation and $4900 for full automation.** Second, we estimate
**substantial heterogeneity in preferences for automation, where a significant share of the
sample is willing to pay above $10,000 for full automation** technology while many are
not willing to pay any positive amount for the technology. Third, our semiparametric random parameter logit estimates suggest that the demand for automation is split approximately evenly between high, modest and no demand, highlighting the importance of
modeling flexible preferences for emerging vehicle technology.

"User preferences regarding autonomous vehicles""

> This study gains insight into individual motivations for choosing to own and use autonomous vehicles and develops a model for autonomous vehicle long-term choice decisions. A stated preference questionnaire is distributed to 721 individuals living across Israel and North America. Based on the characteristics of their current commutes, individuals are presented with various scenarios and asked to choose the car they would use for their commute. A vehicle choice model which includes three options is estimated:
(1)
Continue to commute using a regular car that you have in your possession.
(2)
Buy and shift to commuting using a privately-owned autonomous vehicle (PAV).
(3)
Shift to using a shared-autonomous vehicle (SAV), from a fleet of on-demand cars for your commute.
A factor analysis determined five relevant latent variables describing the individuals’ attitudes: technology interest, environmental concern, enjoy driving, public transit attitude, and pro-AV sentiments. The effects that the characteristics of the individual and the autonomous vehicle have on use and acceptance are quantified through random utility models including logit kernel model taking into account panel effects.

> Currently, large overall hesitations towards autonomous vehicle adoption exist, with 44% of choice decisions remaining regular vehicles. Early AV adopters will likely be young, students, more educated, and spend more time in vehicles. Even if the SAV service were to be completely free, only 75% of individuals would currently be willing to use SAVs. The study also found various differences regarding the preferences of individuals in Israel and North America, namely that Israelis are overall more likely to shift to autonomous vehicles.

> Methods to encourage SAV use include increasing the costs for regular cars as well as educating the public about the benefits of shared autonomous vehicles.
> Highlights
* The choice between regular vehicles, PAVs and SAVs is modelled.
* Five latent variables describe the individuals’ attitudes.
* Large hesitations towards autonomous vehicle adoption currently exist.
* Early AV adopters will likely be young, students, more educated, and spend more time in vehicles.

> Using deep reinforcement learning, we successfully train a set of two autonomous vehicles to lead a fleet of vehicles onto a round-about and then transfer this policy from simulation to a scaled city without fine-tuning. We use Flow, a library for deep reinforcement learning in microsimulators, to train two policies, (1) a policy with noise injected into the state and action space and (2) a policy without any injected noise. In simulation, the autonomous vehicles learn an emergent metering behavior for both policies which allows smooth merging. We then directly transfer this policy without any tuning to the University of Delaware's Scaled Smart City (UDSSC), a 1:25 scale testbed for connected and automated vehicles. We characterize the performance of the transferred policy based on how thoroughly the ramp metering behavior is captured in UDSSC. We show that the noise-free policy results in severe slowdowns and only, occasionally, it exhibits acceptable metering behavior. On the other hand, the noise-injected policy consistently performs an acceptable metering behavior, implying that the noise eventually aids with the zero-shot policy transfer. Finally, the transferred, noise-injected policy leads to a 5% reduction of average travel time and a reduction of 22% in maximum travel time in the UDSSC.
