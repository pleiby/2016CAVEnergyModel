abstract:  A compact and aggregated model of road vehicle travel and energy use is constructed to consider the interactions of multiple relevant identified mechanisms (Wadud et al. 2016, Stephens et al. 2016) by which automation can alter efficiency and activity. Travel demand and vehicle use derives from a standard utility-theoretic specification of driver/traveler behavior. Vehicle efficiency, travel (vehicle-kilometers traveled), average travel speed, congestion, and travel time are endogenous. Following Small and Verhoef (2007) and others, utility derives from travel, aggregate goods consumption, and liesure, subject to individual budget and time constraints.

1. Introduction, Main Points, Key Factors
====================
* Potential value of (goals for) compact/aggregate model: 
    * determine minimum cost to achieve some level of energy use and level of mobility
        * large simulation models would have to do many simulations
    * simulate effect of changing costs from technological advances through vehicle automation, electrification, and sharing. 

#### Important driving factors have an economic dimension
* Demand response to automation and shared mobility
    * consumer behavior model drives demand response
    * particularly, following Small & Verhoef, others, consumer behavior model determines choice of travel VKT, vehicle efficiency, and travel time
    * Utility derives from travel, goods, leisure.
    * Utility maximization subject to joint constraints on budget and time
* Endogenous interactions
    * Speed - (highway free-flow) endogenous to trade-off between energy cost, time and safety costs
    * Congestion â€“ (determines average achieved speed in traffic) endogenous to vehicle mix, VKT, automation
    * Travel demand - endogenous to costs, including energy, congestion and safety, as well as travel time utility (VTT)
    * Distinguish between VKT and PKT, given car-sharing and ride-pooling
        * Compact representation of ride pooling choice
* CAV fuel efficiency follows one of three models
    * The technically feasible case
        - This provides an upper bound on achieved fuel savings, assuming system optimization with respect to energy.
    * CAFE-binding case
        - AVs achieve same MPG as CAFE average, counting some off-cycle benefits. AVs thus have similar intensity as MVs.
    * Cost-effective case 
        - AVs may be more efficient than standard, _if_ further efficiency reductions are cost-effective from a private perspective

#### Key Questions (in order of attention paid here)
* How may vehicle fuel intensity/economy change? 
    * [technical and behavioral factors]
    * [dependence on infrastructure, and degree of penetration]
* How will travel demand change?
    * See EEMS2017 study of travel demand for different VOTT reports 30-50% increase in energy, mostly from demand, depending on VOTT [ToDo: see what this implies for VKTDemandElas]
    * Travel patterns - details omitted
        * Impact: Trip chaining patterns
        * Impact: detailed drive cycle changes (power use over different segments of trip, from detailed traffic interactions and speed changes)
* What are the implications of shared-mobility for energy use and VKT?
    - Important to differentiate shared vehicles (aTaxi or *ride-hailing*) and shared rides (*ride-pooling*)
    - Model through occupancy, incremental VKT from re-positioning, and implications to travelers' cost
* To what extent can CAVs enable fuel switching or electrification?
* How/when will CAVs be adopted? (not addressed)
* What are the special challenges of the transitional period, when a mix of manual, partially automated, and automated vehicles will share the roadways? (not addressed)

#### Contributions of this paper
This paper describes a new aggregated framework, building on established travel demand literature, that account for key features of vehicle automation, and estimates demand and energy use implications. Unlike prior known aggregate work, which relied largely on fixed-coefficient scenario analysis or accounting, it integrates technological and economic factors, including fuel, vehicle and other travel costs, and incorporates energy and travel behavior responses to economic incentives. This work abstracts from much detail offered by micro and mesosimulation models, which estimate travel and energy implications of specific AV technologies using agent/micro/mesosimulation of travel and traffic in real-world spatial and road network models (MATSIM, BEAM, POLARIS, others). The aggregate approach here complements that evolving work and seeks to incorporate some of the insights from that detailed spatial travel modeling. Our framework also is novel in the integration of a utility-based behavioral framework with technological detail and private and public costs, emphasizing the role of financial incentives in the form of costs, fees or taxation/subsidy of transport energy or road use. It extends the private utility maximization framework for travel behavior of Small and Parry 2005, Small and Verhauf 2007, and Leiby and Rubin 2017, combining it with the vehicle efficiency and automated vehicle technological details of Wadud et al 2016. It seeks to address the important issue of how to promote the mobility and energy benefits of CAV technologies while deterring potential adverse outcomes (congestion, emissions) that can have large unaccounted social costs.

#### Limitations
- An incomplete consideration of role of AV safety and its endogenous effect on travel costs and travel behavior.
- The abstraction of potentially important detail, discussed above. It includes only an approximate representation of the effects of AV technologies and systems on vehicle energy use for specific drivetrains, roadway network, traffic conditions, and drivecycles, such as can be modeled in more detailed vehicle and spatial models such as Autonomie, FASTSim, BEAM/POLARIS, etc.


2. Decomposition of Energy and GHG Impacts of CAVs
=========================

The energy and GHG emissions of CAV transportation result from the interaction of a wide range of mechanisms, including the impact of vehicle technologies and vehicle design changes on vehicle operations and efficiency; system-level changes in infrastructure that alter traffic coordination, speeds, and patterns; and consumer behavioral responses that determine the number, length, and nature of trips demanded. The composition of the effects of many of these mechanisms can be conveniently accounted with a _Kaya Identity_, as used in transportation emissions by (McCollum & Yang, 2009, Greene and Plotkin, 2011) or equivalently the _Schipper ASIF framework_ (Schipper et al. 2000, 2011). Mechanistic and scenario-base approaches of this type have been used to explore CAV impacts by Wadud, MacKenzie and Leiby (2016) and by Stephens et al. 2016. While this approch assumes a degree of separability in the impact of certain identified mechanisms on energy use, e.g. weight reduction versus aerodynamic load reduction through platooning, this is supported in some cases by more detailed models and experimental data [cite XXX].

From this so-called *ASIF* approach the total GHG emissions are the product of

1. the level of **A**ctivity (e.g., passenger miles of travel), 
2. the **S**hare of activity for each mode, vehicle, and fuel type, 
3. the energy **I**ntensity of the mode and vehicle type (e.g., energy use per vehicle mile), and 
4. the **F**uel carbon intensity (ghg emission mass per unit energy)

Transportation GHG emissions are then the sum over all transportation modes, vehicle types, and fuels of the product of {Transportation Services Activity^[We differentiate between transportation services (PKT) and vehicle travel (VKT).]} x {Shares of each mode-vehicle-fuel type} x {Energy Intensity} x {Fuel GHG Intensity}.

$$G_t = \Sigma_{m,v} (A_{tv}/o_{tv}) ~ \sigma_{tmv} ~I(\vec x_{tmv}) ~\Sigma_f g_{tf} \phi_{tmvf}$$

Energy use for particular vehicle type is given by total activity (travel demand) level $A_{tv}$, 
the share of travel on mode *m* and the average share-weighted energy intensity of travel by vehicle type and mode.
$$E_{tvf} = (A_{tv}/o_{tv}) ~ \sigma_{tmv} ~I({\vec x}_{tmv}) \phi_{tmvf}$$

Vehicle energy intensity *I* is a function of a vector $\vec x_{tmv}$ of CAV mechanism/technology levels.

Defining indices

- m = transportation mode
- v = vehicle type
- f = fuel type
- t = time period (year)

for sets[^2]

- M = set of transportation modes *m*
- V = set of vehicle types *v*
- F = set of fuel types *f*
- T = set of time periods *t*

[^2]: Additional potential disaggregations include by region, vehicle size class, drivetrain type, and time of day (e.g. operating costs vary by time of day, as described in BÃ¶sch et al. 2017).

The variables are

- $A_{tv}$ = the transportation services Activity provided by type (passenger v.s freight, or LDV/HDV) [billion passenger-km or tonne-km traveled/yr]
- $o_{tv}$ = occupancy of each vehicle type v in year t [pass/veh, or PKT/VKT, for passenger travel; tonne/veh for freight]
- $\sigma_{tmv}$ = share of energy services in transportation mode m by vehicle type v in year t [unitless]
- $\phi_{tmvf}$ = the share of energy-service share $\sigma_{tmv}$ produced by fuel type f [unitless]
- $I_{tvmf}$ = the energy intensity of vehicle v in mode m using fuel type f in year t [MJ/veh-km] ([EJ/Bill veh-km])
- $g_{tf}$ = the GHG intensity of fuel f in year t [g CO2e/MJ (MegaT CO2e/EJ)]
- $E_{tvf}$ = energy use in form of fuel f by vehicle type v in year t [EJ/y]
- $G_{tv}$ = GHGs emitted in year t by type v [MT CO2e/y]

Focusing on passenger travel, we can write energy use $E_{tvf}$ as
$$E_{tvf} = A_{tv} \cdot \frac {1}{o_{tv}} \cdot \Sigma_{m} \sigma_{tvm} \phi_{tvmf} I_{tvmf}$$
with units
$$[EJ/yr] = [bill~ pkm/yr] \cdot [vkm/pkm] \cdot [unitlessShare] \cdot [unitlessShare] \cdot [MJ/vkm]$$

Total Emissions are
$$G_{tv} = \Sigma_f E_{tvf} g_{tf}$$

$$\begin{aligned}
~[bill ~ gCO2e/yr] = [MT CO2e/yr] &= [bill~pkm/yr] \cdot [vkm/pkm] \cdot [unitlessShare] \cdot [unitlessShare] \cdot [MJ/vkm] \cdot [g/MJ] \\
&= [EJ/yr] \cdot [g/MJ]
\end{aligned}
$$
Combining, overall total emissions per year are
$$G_{t} = \Sigma_v \Sigma_f \left [ 
A_{tv} \cdot \frac {1}{o_{tv}} \cdot \Sigma_{m} \left ( \sigma_{tvm} \phi_{tvmf} I_{tvmf} \right ) \right ] g_{tf}$$

Alternatively, in the form of a vector expression over vehicle types *v*,
$$\vec {G_{t}} = \boldsymbol {E_t} \vec {g_t}$$

for $\vec {G_t}$ v x 1, $\boldsymbol {E_t}$ v x f and $\vec {g_t}$ f x 1.
And
$$G_t = \vec {G_{t}} \cdot \boldsymbol {1}$$

In the work here, road travel demand $A_{tv}$ is divided into LDV and HDV (passenger and freight), at the minimum, 
and can be further decomposed into vehicle size classes, and drivetrain classes.

Mechanisms by Which CAVs Can Alter Energy Use and Emissiona
---------------------------
We identified a set *K* of "Mechanisms" or "Technologies" associated with vehicle automation, each $k \in K$ of which has an effect represented by multiplier $\mu_k$ that can increase or decrease a component term in the ASIF decomposition. In general, a mechanism can affect travel activity levels *A*, vehicle energy intensities *I*, or mode and fuel shares $\sigma, \phi$. 
Furthermore, a mechanism could also effect vehicle class shares or occupancy, but we do not yet consider such effects. 

Taking a Scenario Approach, we can construct scenarios *s* that combine technology cases $j \in J$ and demand cases $d \in D$. For each scenario values are indexed by year *t* (for selected years), vehicle class *v*, mechanism *k* and by the Technology/Demand scenario *s*, i.e. $\mu_{tvks}$???.

# [Aside: how to bold E in equation?](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/595/how-can-i-get-bold-math-symbols)  \mathbf for bold non-italic \boldsymbol for bold_italic

SetK_Mechs = c(   # mechanisms k by which automation alters energy and/or demand
  "Platooning",
  "De_emphasized_performance",
  "Improved_crash_avoidance",

SetV_Class = c("LDV", "HDV")  # Vehicle Classes v

SetS_Sense = c(               # Sensitivity cases s for mechanism effects
  "Opt",
  "Mid",
  "Pess",
  "Zero"
)

```

The set of mechanisms *k* represented include: `r paste(SetK_Mechs, collapse=', ')`.  We consider vehicle classes *v* in `r paste(SetV_Class, collapse=', ')`. The model is explored over time for years *t* from `r min(SetT_Years)` to `r max(SetT_Years)`.

3. Estimating Energy Impacts
===========================

We define the effects of automation on vehicle energy intensity (energy per vehicle km traveled) through a set of identified technological and operational "mechanisms." 

The estimation for the midcase energy intensity impacts of each mechanism is based on literature review^[We start from the values developed in Wadud, MacKenzie and Leiby 2016.] and the external calculations of the authors. Ranges of values, for sensitivity cases and scenarios, are constructed for each mechanism *k*, for sensitivity cases *s* from "zero" through "pessimistic," "midcase," and "optimistic." Mechanism intensity effect values $I_{E,tvks}$ indicate the fractional change in energy intensity for a particular mechanism *k*, and are differentiated by year *t*, vehicle class *v*, and scenario *s*???.

### 3.1 Construct multiplicative factors to apply to energy intensities for each mechanism

From the fractional changes in energy intensity, multipliers $\mu_{tvks}$ are constructed to apply for each mechanism/technology *k*, year *t*, vehicle class *v*, and sensitivity case???scenario *s*.

$\mu_{tvks} = 1.0 + I_{E,tvks}$

A multiplier value of 1.0 indicates no change and less/greater than one implies a multiplicative reduction/increase in energy intensity.

```{r constrIEffects, warning=FALSE, echo=echoWorking}
# Get (compound) case name and split into separate variables for each part

#IEffects$EffectCase = row.names(IEffects)
#IEffects = separate(data=IEffects, col=EffectCase, into=c("VC","Year", "Mech"), sep="\\.")

# From percent-change to fractional-change, then to multiplier
IEffectsm = IEffects %>% gather(key=EffectCase, value="IE", Opt:Zero) %>%
  mutate(IE = IE/100.0) %>%
  mutate(IM = 1+IE)   # These Intensity Multipliers are the "mu" factors

# IM = dataframe(TechScen, DmndScen, Mech, Year, VC) # intensity multiplying factors

IM = IEffectsm %>% select(-IE) %>%
  spread(key = EffectCase, value = IM) %>%
  arrange(desc(VC), Year)
  # arrange(order(match(Mech, IEffects$Mech)))
# sort columns same way as original data frame
IM = IM[,c(colnames(IEffects))]

kable(x = IM, 
      caption= "Intensity Multipliers by Vehicle-type, Year, and Case")
```

* Note "Right_sizing" and "Increased_feature_load" apply only to LDV passenger travel.

### 3.2 Energy Intensity by Vehicle Type and Technology Scenario, by Composing Mechanism Effects

We construct Scenario Multipliers $\mu_{jtv}$ (supressing subscripts *m, f*) for the vehicle energy intensity of each Scenario *j*, for Year *t* and Vehicle class *v* based on the combined the effect of all the mechanisms.

For each technology scenario *j*, year *t*, vehicle class *v* and mechanism *k*, the "EffectCase" or effect sensitivity case *s* is specified, i.e. 

$s_{jtvk}$ for 
$s \in \{Zero, Low, Mid, High\}$.

This determines the appropriate intensity multiplier for each mechanism.

```{r constructIntensityByScenMech, echo=echoWorking, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Load the descriptions of the scenarios
mechScenAssumps = read_csv(paste0("./Data/","CAV_Scenario_Master.csv"), comment = "#")
# This table contains: scenario number and demand scenario number;
# resulting multipliers for LDV and HDV in 2 years;
# scenario name and description; and setting levels (Zero, Low, Mid, High) for each mechanism 

msa = mechScenAssumps %>% 
  select(-c(LDV_Multipliers.2035:Scenario_Description)) %>%  # drop aggregatred result for scenario and Name, Description
  gather(key=VehMechYear, value = EffectCase, LDV.Platooning.2035:HDV.Higher_highway_speeds.2050)
msa = separate(msa, VehMechYear, c("VC", "Mech", "Year"), sep="\\.")
msa$Year = as.integer(msa$Year)
# As in ='[CAV Energy ASIF Framework WadudMacKenzieLeiby V20161024.xlsx]Policy+Scenario'!$A$11
# As in  '[CAV Energy ASIF Framework WadudMacKenzieLeiby V20161024.xlsx]Scenario Master'!$A$3:$F$11

# Match Energy Intensity Impacts for each mechanism in the scenario to the 
#   Scenario Assumptions for that mechanism: 
#   IEffectsm$IM is the intensity multiplier for each VC, Year, Mech (mech) and EffectCase
#   msa$EffectCase is one of (Zero, Opt, Mid, Pess) for each VC, Year, Mech
# IEffectsm has 128 = 2 x 2 x 8 x 4, while msa has 224 rows
# merge, keeping matching rows from second, bringing in IE and IM for each Mech
msa = left_join(msa, IEffectsm, by = c("VC", "Year", "Mech", "EffectCase")) %>% 
  select(-c(Demand_Scenario, IE)) # drop fractional reductions, keep multipliers
```

```{r reportScenarioAssumps, echo=echoWorking, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
scenAssumps = msa %>% select(-IM) %>%
  # scenAssumps = scenAssumps[,c("Scenario_Number", "VC", "Year", "Mech", "EffectCase")] # re-order cols
  spread(key = Scenario_Number, value = EffectCase) %>% 
  arrange(Year, desc(VC))
kable(x = scenAssumps, 
      caption= "Effect Sensitivity Cases by Vehicle Class, Year, AV Mechanism and Scenario")
```

*??? VoTT assumptions for LDV and HDV by Scenario?*

The total energy intensity multiplier for each scenario *j* is the product of all mechanism multipliers^[Here mode *m* and fuel *f* are initially suppressed and fixed. I.e. *m* = road_vehicle and *f* = petro] 
$\mu_{jtv} = \prod_{k} \mu_{tvk{s_{jtvk}}}$

The Net Energy Intensity change is the difference between the combined effect of the intensity mechanism multipliers and 1.0.
$$\Delta I_{jtv} \equiv \mu_{jtv}-1 ~=~ \prod_{k} \mu_{tvk{s_{jtvk}}}-1$$


```{r constructIntensityByScenario, echo=echoWorking, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Overall energy intensity for the scenario is the product of mechanism multipliers
EnergyIntensityChanges = msa %>%
  group_by(Year, VC, Scenario_Number) %>%
  summarize(NIE = prod(IM)-1)  # product of multipliers across all Mech(anisms)
# minus 1 for net change

4. Demand Response to CAVs
=========================

In addition to the changes in energy intensity we account for a travel demand response based on the change in net generalized cost of travel.

### Select a Single Scenario to Examine

```{r singleScenarioSelect, echo=echoWorking}
CurrTechScen = 4

```

Energy Intensity change is dependent on the Technology Scenario, and year of interest.

For example consider Scenario `r CurrTechScen`, the "`r mechScenAssumps[[CurrTechScen,"Scenario_Name"]]`" scenario, in year `r CurrYear`. 

Update demand response parameters with energy intensity reduction (by vehicle class and year) for this Technology Scenario,

```{r reportDemRespParams, echo=echoWorking}
nie = EnergyIntensityChanges  %>% ungroup() %>% 
  filter(Scenario_Number == CurrTechScen, Year == CurrYear) %>% 
  select(VC, NIE)

# This assignment is awkward, due to non-ideal organization of data tables.
#  Get updated change in net energy intensity (based on product of active mechanisms in current tech scenario and year)
#DemRespParams$NIE = EnergyIntensityChange$NIE  # for matching VC, and Parameter=='I_deltaCAV'
DemRespParams %>% gather(key = Sens, value = value, Low:Zero)  %>%  # following assigns the same

4.3 Fractional Increase in VKT for Demand Scenarios
---------------------------------

Calculate fractional change in demand, by Demand Scenario *d*, Year *t*, and VehicleClass *v*, based on changes in 
time cost, other vehicle fuel and operating costs, and VMT demand elasticity w.r.t generalized cost.

### Demand Scenario Cost Reduction Parameters and Demand Response Parameters Drive Demand Scenarios

Note: The definition of automation _demand_ scenarios is by their impacts on selectec component costs (e.g. travel time costs, insurance costs). They are not CAV penetration scenarios. 
Penetration is assumed 100%.

### Vehicle Travel Cost Shares by Component - Base

```{r calcCostSharesbyComponentBase, echo=echoWorking}

# divide every element by TotCost_cpm to get shares
VTCShrBase = VTCostBase %>% spread(key = CostCat, value = VTCost_cpm) %>%
  mutate_at(vars(-c(VehType,Total)), funs( ./Total)) %>%

kable(VTCShrBase, row.names = F, 
      caption= "Base Vehicle Travel Cost: Components Share by Vehicle Type")
              
```

### Cost Shares by Component - CAV Scenario

Costs (relative to Base) are adjusted for assumptions of each Demand Scenario and for the Energy Intensity change associated with the current Technology Scenario. 

Base cost components $\sigma_{itv}^B$ are normalized and add to 1.0. Demand Scenario *relative* costs for each component *i* are relative to the Base (Manual Vehicle) level. Their total can be greater than or less than 1.0. Denoted $\sigma_{itdjv}$, they depend on cost component *i*, Year *t* and Demand Scenario *d*, TechScenario *j*, Year *t*, Vehicle class *v*

- Fuel costs per mile are adjusted by the Scenario Multipliers for energy intensity, $\mu_{jtv}$ for TechScenario *j*, Year *t*, Vehicle class *v*. That is, for cost component $i = fuel$
$$\sigma_{fuel,vtdj} = \sigma_{fuel,vtdj}^B \cdot (1+\mu_{jtv}f_{fuelvis,v})$$

```{r calcCostSharesbyComponentCAV, echo=echoWorking}
# Start with dataframe replicates the Base Cost Shares for each Demand Scenario

4.5 Fractional VMT Changes in CAV Scenario
-------------------

Compute fractional increases in VMT from the changes in total generalized travel costs that result from automation.

For Demand Scenario *d*, Vehicle Type *v*, and Elasticity Case *c* (Low and High elasticity)
$$fractionalVMTIncr_{dvc} = (RelTotalCost_{dv})^{ElasVKT_{cv}}-1$$

Note: The Elasticity of VKT with respect to (generalized) travel cost is key assumption. Does this include mode switching, vehicle efficiency, locational choices, etc?
Sources for ElasVKT: (HERS-ST technical report, August 2005 + Graham and Glaister 2002)

Travel Time Budget
-------------------
BGR2014:144 (referencing Shaefer et al. 2009) apply a Travel Time Budget constraint in the following straight-forward way:
$$D/S = D_r/S_r$$
Travel time (distance _D_ over speed _S_) must equal reference travel time.  (Appears that they apply this to all travel based on average speed, and assume a 50% increase in average speed.)

More generally, the travel time can  be expected to vary in response to travel costs and income.

6. Simple functions for MPG as a function of highway speed
=============================

6.1 Fuel Consumption vs. Speed - Thomas et al. Approach
----------------------

* Source: Thomas, J., Hwang, H.-L., West, B., & Huff, S. (2013). Predicting Light-Duty Vehicle Fuel Economy as a Function of Highway Speed. SAE International Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems, 6(2), 2013-01-1113. doi:10.4271/2013-01-1113

  > Thomas et al. performed "analysis of dynamometer testing results for 74 vehicles at steady-state speeds from 50 to 80 mph [80 to 129 km/h].  Data has been collected for 23 light-duty vehicles at ORNL's vehicle research laboratory and a valuable data set for 51 vehicles was loaned to ORNL by Chrysler, LLC under a non-disclosure agreement. Vehicles were tested in dynamometer laboratories at steady speeds from 40 to 80 mph [64 to 129 km/h], with the proper road-load applied. ... The study includes various sizes of sedans, wagons, and SUVs, as well as pickup trucks, minivans and a few "muscle" and sports cars. Vehicles from model years 2003 to 2012 with a wide variety of powertrains were represented" [ORNL researchers quantify the effect of increasing highway speed on fuel economy](http://www.greencarcongress.com/2013/01/thomas-20130117.html) Jan 18, 2013

**Summary of MPG vs. Speed data:
Percent mpg decrease for a given 10 mph increase based on 74 vehicles.**

Speed increase             | Average   | Data range    | Std. deviation | Middle 2/3s of vehicle data
---------------------------|-----------|---------------|----------------|----------------------
50 to 60 mph               | 12.4      | 6.9-18.3      | 2.2            | 10.0-14.3
60 to 70 mph               | 14.0      | 8.8-19.5      | 2.6            | 11.2-16.1
70 to 80 mph               | 15.4      | 10.8-26.0     | 3.0            | 12.5-17.5
All three speed increments | 13.9      | 6.9-26.0      | 2.9            | N/A

We can calculate the percentage decrease in MPG for a range of speed changes using the methodology Thomas, Hwang, West and Huff 2013.

7. Safety Costs Associated with Speed
======================

* [Road safety - Speed](http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/publications/road_traffic/world_report/speed_en.pdf) World Health Organization, 2004
  - An increase in average speed of 1 km/h typically results in a 3% higher risk of a crash involving injury, with a 4-5% increase for crashes that result in fatalities.
  - Speed also contributes to the severity of the impact when a collision does occur. For car occupants in a crash with an impact speed of 80 km/h, the likelihood of death is 20 times what it would have been at an impact speed
of 30 km/h.
* WHO 2004 World report on road traffic injury prevention
** Crash Risk**
    - WHO 2004 [World report on road traffic injury prevention](http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/42871/1/9241562609.pdf)
    - http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/publications/road_traffic/world_report/en/
    - The probability of a crash involving an injury is proportional to the square of the speed. The probability of a serious crash is proportional to the cube of the speed. The probability of a fatal crash is related to the fourth power of
the speed (38, 39). [Chap 3, Crash Risk, p.78]
    - Empirical evidence from speed studies in various countries has shown that an increase of 1 km/h in mean traffic speed typically results in a 3% increase in the incidence of injury crashes (or an increase of 4-5% for fatal crashes), and a decrease of 1 km/h in mean traffic speed will result in a 3% decrease in
the incidence of injury crashes (or a decrease of 4-5% for fatal crashes) (40).
    - Taylor et al. (41, 42), in their study on different types of roads in the United Kingdom, concluded that for every 1 mile/h (1.6 km/h) reduction in average traffic speed, the highest reduction achievable in the volume of
crashes was 6% (in the case of urban roads with low average speeds). These are typically busy main roads in towns with high levels of pedestrian activity, wide variations in speeds and high frequencies of crashes.
    - A meta-analysis of 36 studies on speed limit changes showed, at levels above 50 km/h, a decrease of 2% in the number of crashes for every 1 km/h reduction in the average speed (43).
    - For car occupants in a crash with an impact speed of
50 miles/h (80 km/h), the likelihood of death is 20 times
what it would have been at an impact speed of 20 miles/h
(32 km/h) (48).

### **Severity of crash injuries**

- Speed has an exponentially detrimental effect on
safety. As speeds increase, so do the number and
severity of injuries. Studies show that the higher
the impact speed, the greater the likelihood of serious
and fatal injury:
    - For car occupants, the severity of crash injury
depends on the change of speed during the
impact, usually denoted as $\delta$v. As $\delta$v increases
from about 20 km/h to 100 km/h, the probability
of fatal injuries increases from close to
zero to almost 100% (46).
    - The probability of serious injury for belted
front-seat occupants is three times as great at
30 miles/h (48 km/h) and four times as great
at 40 miles/h (64 km/h), compared with the
risk at 20 miles/h (32 km/h) (47).
    - For car occupants in a crash with an impact
speed of 50 miles/h (80 km/h), the likelihood
of death is 20 times what it would have been at
an impact speed of 20 miles/h (32 km/h) (48).
    - Pedestrians have a 90% chance of surviving car
crashes at 30 km/h or below, but less than a
50% chance of surviving impacts at 45 km/h
or above (49, 50) (see Figure 3.3).
    - The probability of a pedestrian being killed rises
by a factor of eight as the impact speed of the car
increases from 30 km/h to 50 km/h (51).
    - Older pedestrians are even more physically vulnerable as speeds increase (52) (see Figure 3.4).
    - Excess and inappropriate speed contributes to around 30% of fatal crashes in high-income countries (53).

  > Assessing potential effectiveness of speed reduction measures
Based on work by Nilsson in Sweden, a change in average speed of 1 km/h will result in a change in accident numbers ranging between 2% for a 120 km/h road and 4% for a 50 km/h road. This result has been confirmed by many before and after studies of different speed reduction measures. This relationship is used by other Scandinavian countries and by Australian and Dutch safety engineers.

  > A similar relationship is assumed in Britain, based on empirical studies by Taylor, where changes in accident numbers associated with a 1 km/h change in speed have been shown to vary between 1% and 4% for urban roads and 2.5% and 5.5% for rural roads, with the lower value reflecting good quality roads and the higher value poorer quality roads.

  > Higher speeds: more accidents : High speed reduces the possibility to respond in time when necessary. People need time to process information, to decide whether or not to react and, finally to execute a reaction. At high speed the distance covered in this period is longer. At high speeds the distance between starting to brake and a complete stand still is longer as well. The braking distance is proportional to the square of speed (v2). Therefore, the possibility to avoid a collision becomes smaller as speed increases. This is well illustrated at a broad average level by Finch [24].

  1 km/h increase in speed implies a 3% increase in accidents
 
  > In practice the relationship is more complex. ...The higher the speed, the steeper the increase in accident risk.  The relationship between speed and accident risk is a power function:

  > Based on the principles of kinetic energy and validated by empirical data, Nilsson [[44](Nilsson, G. (1982) The effects of speed limits on traffic crashes in Sweden. In: Proceedings of the international symposium on the effects of speed limits on traffic crashes and fuel consumption, Dublin. Organisation for Economy, Co-operation, and Development (OECD), Paris)][[45](Nilsson, G. (2004) Traffic safety dimensions and the power model to describe the effect of speed on safety. Bulletin 221, Lund Institute of Technology, Lund)] developed the following formula:
$$A_2 = A_1 \left ( \frac{V_2}{V_1} \right )^2$$

  > In words: the number of injury accidents after the change in speed (A2) equals the number of accidents before the change (A1) multiplied by the new average speed (v2) divided by the former average speed (v1), raised to the square power.
